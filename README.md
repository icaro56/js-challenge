## Javascript game challenge 
This is my solution for the Pushstart javascript game challenge. The challenge is to create a game in Javascript using the PixiJS graphics engine and the GSAP animation library. The challenge can be found at the link: https://bitbucket.org/pushstartstudio/challenge-javascript-game/src/master/

## Commands:

-   `npm run build` - starts build procedure
-   `npm run dev` - start watching for files and open's server on localhost:8080
-   `npm run test` - run tests
-   `npm run code-coverage` - generate code coverage report
-   `npm run code-style-check` - run's eslint and prettier check on your code

For vscode users - ctrl ( or âŒ˜ ) + shift + b will run the watch build as its set as default vscode task

## Production

After execute the command `npm run build`, enter in folder `dist` using a Terminal and execute the command `http-server`

## Tasks
All basic tasks have been developed. 

## Optional Tasks
- Integrate with the PushStart API to load the levels. 
- Develop a level generator 
- Develop Visual Improvements. I made some improvements. 
- I did unit test for the classes.
